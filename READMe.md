# What is this?
Second I like to make dumb stuff to make my friends laugh so I have included a really dum addon to track the whereabouts of a guildie.
- I am learning to make addons by creating dumb things to make people laugh
- This is also a cheap hyperfixation

# How do I use whatever sub-alpha version I found on github?
- Target someone and use the slash command /gottem
- Access some meager options with /zui

# When will it be ready?
- I hope to have have this ready for the launch of TWW 

# To do:
## Messager
- Message window timeout that resets with new message
- Re-attach settings window to messager
- Eliminate more useless globals

## Suggestions
- clickable coordinates that create a map pin (or tomtom waypont)
- different functionality in dungeon
- Sender class colors

> [!CAUTION]
> Evil Follows

## M+ Data backburnered - this is a pain:
- Write trigger(s) for incomplete key
- Data input - reason
- Save Output in readable fomat - python(shittylua lib)
  * ultimate goal is to store all output in googlesheets
- Store tracked data as ID not name
