# What is this?
I created this addon because I like to keep stats of my mythic+ runs and raider.io and other utilities do not keep data on incomplete runs. There is no reason of this besides that I am a nerd and I like to learn

Second I like to make dumb stuff to make my friends laugh so I have included a really dum addon to track the whereabouts of a guildie.
- I am learning to make addons by creating dumb things to make people laugh
- This is also a cheap hyperfixation

# When will it be ready?
> [!WARNING] 
>I have a poor track record of finishing dumb > projects like this
- I hope to have have this ready for the launch of TWW 

# What do I still need to do?
## M+ Data Priority List:
- [ ] Write trigger(s) for incomplete key
- [ ] Save Output
  * Would like data stored in google sheets

## DorkSpotter Priority List
- [ ] Callback handler for the addon chat
- [ ] Throttling for the addon chat
- [ ] Sync/Save

> [!CAUTION]
> :dagger: Yes I know libraries exist :dagger:

# What have I crossed off the list?
- [x] make main window movable
- [x] save main window position
