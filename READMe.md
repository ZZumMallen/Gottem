# What is this?
Second I like to make dumb stuff to make my friends laugh so I have included a really dum addon to track the whereabouts of a guildie.
- I am learning to make addons by creating dumb things to make people laugh
- This is also a cheap hyperfixation

# How do I use whatever sub-alpha version I found on github?
- Target someone and use the slash command /gottem
- Access some meager options with /zui


# When will it be ready?
- I hope to have have this ready for the launch of TWW 

# To do:
## Messager
- [ ] Readable timestamp
- [ ] Store frame positions
- [ ] Message Hide() timer
- [ ] Sync - longshot

## Gottem
- [ ] Fix list

> [!CAUTION]
> Evil Follows

## M+ Data backburnered - this is a pain:
- [ ] Write trigger(s) for incomplete key
- [ ] Save Output
  * Would like data stored in google sheets
- [ ] Get/Save Position

Save this because I hate typing checkboxes in MD
- [ ] -
