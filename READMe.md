# What is this?
I created this addon because I like to keep stats of my mythic+ runs and raider.io and other utilities do not keep data on incomplete runs. There is no reason of this besides that I am a nerd and I like to learn

Second I like to make dumb stuff to make my friends laugh so I have included a really dum addon to track the whereabouts of a guildie.
- I am learning to make addons by creating dumb things to make people laugh
- This is also a cheap hyperfixation

# When will it be ready?
> [!WARNING] 
>I have a poor track record of finishing dumb > projects like this
- I hope to have have this ready for the launch of TWW
