# What is this?
I created this addon because I like to keep stats of my mythic+ runs and raider.io and other utilities do not keep data on incomplete runs. There is no reason of this besides that I am a nerd and I like to learn

Second I like to make dumb stuff to make my friends laugh so I have included a really dum addon to track the whereabouts of a guildie.
- I am learning to make addons by creating dumb things to make people laugh
- This is also a cheap hyperfixation

# How do I use it?
- Target someone and use the slash command /gottem
- Access some meager options with /zui

> [!CAUTION]
> There is not throttling apam control... Use at your own risk

# When will it be ready?
> [!WARNING] 
>I have a poor track record of finishing dumb > projects like this
- I hope to have have this ready for the launch of TWW 

# To do:
## Messager
- [ ] Readable timestamp
- [ ] Create a reasonable frame to hold the alert
- [ ] Throttling!!!
- [ ] Save
- [ ] Sync - longshot

## Core
- [ ] Selector for frame vs. chat
- [ ] Dumbstuff selector
- [ ] Enable/Disable Gottem

## Gottem
- [ ] Fix list


> [!CAUTION]
> Evil Follows

## M+ Data backburnered - this is a pain:
- [ ] Write trigger(s) for incomplete key
- [ ] Save Output
  * Would like data stored in google sheets
- [ ] Get/Save Position

Save this because I hate typing checkboxes in MD
- [ ] -
